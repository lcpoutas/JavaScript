# JavaScript Scripts and Exercises Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript repository! This is a collection of scripts and exercises that demonstrate different aspects of JavaScript programming. The repository is organized into various sections, each covering important JavaScript concepts and practices.

## Sections

1. **AJAX**: Scripts demonstrating the use of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) for making HTTP requests, working with APIs, fetching data dynamically, and updating the DOM without reloading the page.
2. **ArrayMethods**: Exercises and examples showcasing how to work with JavaScript array methods such as `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.forEach()`, and others to manipulate and transform arrays effectively.
3. **DOM**: Scripts focused on DOM manipulation, where you will find examples of how to select, modify, and dynamically interact with elements on the webpage using JavaScript.
4. **ejercicios**: A collection of JavaScript exercises to practice basic and advanced concepts, including variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and more.
5. **ejer_logicaProgramacion**: Exercises focused on building programming logic using JavaScript. These are designed to challenge problem-solving skills and apply algorithmic thinking.

## How to Use

Each section is organized into its own folder containing relevant scripts and files. Here's a brief overview on how to work with each of them.

### Running **AJAX** Scripts

In the **AJAX** folder, you'll find examples of using `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch()`, and promises for asynchronous operations. To run these scripts, you may need to use a local or live server (e.g., using VSCode's Live Server extension) since AJAX calls often require a server to fetch data.

### Running **ArrayMethods** Examples

The **ArrayMethods** folder contains JavaScript scripts that demonstrate different ways to work with arrays. These scripts can be run directly in the browser's console or in an HTML file. Simply open the corresponding `.html` file in a browser to see the results.

### Working with **DOM** Manipulation

The **DOM** folder includes examples of how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. You can run these scripts by opening the HTML files associated with the examples in a web browser, which will allow you to see the dynamic changes to the web page.

### Solving **ejercicios**

In the **ejercicios** folder, you'll find a variety of standalone JavaScript exercises. You can copy these scripts into the browser's console or include them in an HTML file to execute and practice.

### Solving **ejer_logicaProgramacion**

The **ejer_logicaProgramacion** folder focuses on exercises aimed at developing your programming logic. These scripts are meant to be solved by breaking down problems into smaller steps. Run them in the browser or with Node.js to check your solutions.
